How to test running on Git Hub Actions

We will deploy triggering GH Actions. At the end we will destroy from a local computer.

Grab the variables below (TIP fill it, you will need to paste it on your terminal to destroy)

acm_cert_arn=
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
domain_name=
hosted_zone_id=
ssh_allowed_cidr=
tf_backend_bucket=

Go to GH Settings > Secrets and fill up these variables.

Trigger the Actions

1. Change any file on terraform folder and push, open a PR - It will trigger Make Plan
2. Approve the PR it will trigger Make Apply
3. Change any file on docker folder and push - It will trigger Make publish
4. PR the published file and approve PT-  It will trigger Make deploy-wp

Wait a few minuites to see the container running on your domain.

How to destroy:

You should have terrafrom and on you local computer

git clone git@github.com:devopsacademyau/2020-jun-project1-group3.git
paste the variables block
make destroy

REMEMBER TO OVERWRITE YOUR AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ON GIT HUB ACTIONS AFTER THE END AND DELETE THIS ACCESS KEYS ON AWS

As an alternative you can deploy from your local computer
git clone git@github.com:devopsacademyau/2020-jun-project1-group3.git
