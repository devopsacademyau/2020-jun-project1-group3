*  Containeraize the application using Docker.
*  The application needs to be secure (all data encrypted at rest and in transit).
*  The application needs to be Highly Available.
* The application needs to support peaks of up to 10 times the average load (scalability).
* The infrastructure needs to be reproducible and version controlled in case the CEO decides to expand the business to other parts of the world (consider infra as code).
* There must be an easy and secure way of developing, with fast feedback (consider CI/CD practices or at least automation scripts).

#### __PROJECT TIMELINE__
The pilot project is expected to be completed and reviewed by mid August 2020, and ready for demostration on **17th August 2020**

### __DELIVERABLES:__
* A solution diagram containing all the components of the solution and explaining the data flow.

* Automatic Deployemnt strategy.
* Strategy for Logging and Alarming the health of the system.
* Strategy for handling application component failure.
* List Improvements or Features not delivered in this phase

### __ASSUMPTIONS__

1. Data Migration is out of scope as it is a pilot migration.
2. Consider to include the Unit/Integration/service test in the CI pipeline or automation scripts.
3. Single GitHib repo will be delivered.
4. This pilot migration will be delivered using Terraform code.
