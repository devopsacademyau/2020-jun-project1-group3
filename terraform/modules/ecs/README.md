### ECS CLUSTER CREATION
 ECS Cluster is created with the image from DockerHub - wordpress:php7.4
 ECS FARGATE requires Subnets, and hence pointed to already existing subnet for test purpose.
 Once the ALB/Network Architecture is created, a full fledged testing is required pointing to the aws_subnets created on the fly.
